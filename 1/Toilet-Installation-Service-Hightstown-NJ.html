<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention methods.
