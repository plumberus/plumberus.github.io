<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention methods.

However even if you're often getting bouts of cold water throughout your hot shower then you must hire our League City hot water heater repair professionals.
