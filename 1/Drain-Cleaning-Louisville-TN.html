When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health hazard if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
