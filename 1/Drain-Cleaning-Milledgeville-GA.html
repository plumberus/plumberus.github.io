<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>

<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
