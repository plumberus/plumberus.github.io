<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
