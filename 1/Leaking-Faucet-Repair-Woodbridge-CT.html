<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Woodbridge CT</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
