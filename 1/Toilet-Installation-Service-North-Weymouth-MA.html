<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can stop working to carry water from roofing rain gutters away from your house or company when not correctly preserved. Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases clogs are inevitable.
