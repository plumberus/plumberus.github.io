<p>We're changing a gas water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a gas hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are similar. Repeating repairs and leakages. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As an outcome, we suggest changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
