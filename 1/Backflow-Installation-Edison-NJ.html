<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
