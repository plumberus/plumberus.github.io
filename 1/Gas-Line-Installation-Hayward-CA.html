<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
