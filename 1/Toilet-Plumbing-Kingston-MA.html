<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its regular circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water system is developed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "normal," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for polluted water entering the potable water distribution system.</p>
<p>These branching circulation pipelines form networks and loops including water pipe and supply pipelines. Water mains range in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines offer water for whole neighborhoods as well as big commercial, residential and commercial complexes. Depending on the flow capability, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to restore and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
