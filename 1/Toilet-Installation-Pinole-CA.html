<p>The average cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending upon the size and model. They are much safer to use than continuous feed disposals, but are not advised for families that produce a great deal of food waste.

<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
