<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>When you have a clogged piping system in your Miami, Florida premises, you can either select a plumber who collects your backyard, excavates the walls and destroy the foundation during the pipe repairs, or you can have the foresight to hire a professional such as Eco 1 Plumbing. If you need pipes changed, you will have to employ a professional plumber. The cost of having pipes fixed or changed can vary significantly depending upon the location of the pipes, the real problem, and the question of repairing or replacing; however usually, the cost to replace pipes is $80-$ 440 per hour or a repaired price of about $222.
