<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
