<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
