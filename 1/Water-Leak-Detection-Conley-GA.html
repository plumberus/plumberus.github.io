<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, accumulated food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the centerpiece in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable supply of water within a building these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
