<p>If the water heater leaks or burst, high water pressure also leads to thermal growth in water heaters which can lead to possible water damage.

Replacing the pipes for numerous plumbing components requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>Inspecting the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this might be serious problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in the house must have water. This goes for every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a good start if everything is working properly.</p>

And sometimes you're simply prepared for a kitchen update. , if you desire one or more sinks in your home to have soft water for simpler dish washing, under-sink and countertop softeners can help.
