<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
