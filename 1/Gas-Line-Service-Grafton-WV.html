When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-term option.</p>
