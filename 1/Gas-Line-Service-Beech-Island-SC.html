<p>Leakages are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
