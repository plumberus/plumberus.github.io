Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
