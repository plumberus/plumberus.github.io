<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Marlow OK 73055</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
