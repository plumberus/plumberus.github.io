<p>Checking the water meter is a terrific next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. There is a leak someplace and this might be major problem if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in the house ought to have water.
