<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 various celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, just like each person we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were polite, timely, and very experienced. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone requiring either big or little task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Blockages that continue after you've attempted to repair them call for professional assistance. Continued efforts on your own can damage your lines, and you may have a more major underlying issue than you understand. In addition, the longer you postpone to call for professional support, the higher the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
