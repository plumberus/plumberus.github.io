<p>Remove electrical cover plate and detach the disposal from the electrical connections. Rock salt contains a lot of matter that is not water-soluble. As a result, the softening tanks need to be cleaned up much more regularly, when rock salt is utilized. Rock salt is cheaper than evaporated salt and solar salt, but reservoir cleaning may take up a lot of your time and energy.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the new line throughout installation. Less parts in the system result in fewer tankless water heater repair consultations.</p>
