<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
