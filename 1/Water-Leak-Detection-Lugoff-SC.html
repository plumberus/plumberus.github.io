<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a lp water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Repeating repairs and leaks. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we suggest changing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
