<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try in Belle Vernon PA 15012</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
