<p>The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires numerous items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be examined. The installation must be examined to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test information should be built up to identify the functions of each part. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was correctly repaired. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flowchart is required to guarantee it was fixed properly. A correctly fixed assembly must provide years of protection.</p>
