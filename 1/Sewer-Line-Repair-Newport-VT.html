One way to test for any leakages in your plumbing is to turn off all water appliances in the house and outdoors (sprinklers, pipes, etc.). Then locate and see the numbers on your home's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the much faster those numbers go up, the larger the leak.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
