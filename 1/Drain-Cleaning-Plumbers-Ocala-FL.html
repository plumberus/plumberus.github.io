If your showers end up being disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
