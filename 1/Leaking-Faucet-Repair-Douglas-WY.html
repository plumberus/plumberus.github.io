For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the safe and clean water system. To safeguard water quality, backflow security is required where the end user poses a danger of polluting the city's water supply.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past.

Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs.
