<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and solidify or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

Faulty Parts: If your toilet will not stop running, it's most likely due to problems with a toilet tank element. In such cases, we are normally able to replace that single element.
