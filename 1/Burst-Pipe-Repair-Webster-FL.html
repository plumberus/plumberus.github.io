<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
