<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions.
