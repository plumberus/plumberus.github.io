<p>Our licensed plumbing specialists can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain.

So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a quick fix in the short-term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
