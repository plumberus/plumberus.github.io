When it's time for replacement, here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, as with everyone we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and really knowledgeable. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either big or small job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
