<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
