<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller private service pipes, carrying water to individual houses, home shops, structures and businesses. Depending on demand, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches.

Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure.

A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
