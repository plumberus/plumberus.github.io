On average, the life-span of most water heaters is in between ten and fifteen years. Obviously, this life-span varies according to the frequency of usage and care and maintenance. Understanding when it's time for water heater repair allows you to make informed choices and guarantee a consistent supply of clean, safe hot water.</p>

<p>Rather of drudging big trenches to access your underground sewer system, Roto-Rooter service technicians will drill simply a couple of holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it quickly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal choice for your home or business.
