<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at Franklin MA 02038</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and harden or just be so crushed that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
