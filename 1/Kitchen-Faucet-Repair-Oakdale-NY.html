<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
