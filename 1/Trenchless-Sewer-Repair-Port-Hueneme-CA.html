<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Discovering high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the house resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be regulated to keep the system healthy. When uncontrolled water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding.
