<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public supply of water and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
