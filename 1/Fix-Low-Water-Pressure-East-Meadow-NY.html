<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and responsibility are exceptionally crucial to building a credibility for quality. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet need to be above the drain line coming out of the wall. If it isn't, you'll need to either choose a smaller sized disposer, or customize the plumbing to accommodate the new setup. Foul smells. A practical sewer line must always be sealed airtight, indicating no water or gas should ever leak out. If nevertheless, you start smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around your house, there might be a crack someplace in your sewer line.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
