<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In houses with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system.

Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
