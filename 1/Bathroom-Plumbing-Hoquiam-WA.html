Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to versatile rubber traps. Debris can easily capture in this kind of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer needed assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
