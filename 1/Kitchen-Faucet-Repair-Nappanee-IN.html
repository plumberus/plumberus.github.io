Things worsen drastically for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
