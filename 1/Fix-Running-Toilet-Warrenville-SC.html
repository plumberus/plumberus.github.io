<p>Like many household home appliances, your water heater is one of those things that gets considered granted - till it goes kaput. Then it gathers all the attention it deserves. Typically, the life expectancy of the majority of water heaters is between 10 and fifteen years. Naturally, this lifespan differs according to the frequency of usage and care and maintenance. Understanding when it's time for water heater repair permits you to make informed decisions and ensure a continuous supply of clean, safe warm water.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include appliance wires connected, and others do not. If yours does not, eliminate the cover plate beneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's directions. Most standard disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're completed.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
