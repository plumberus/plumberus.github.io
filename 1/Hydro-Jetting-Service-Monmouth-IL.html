<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

<p>Water softeners leakages are primarily caused because of an issue at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely cracked and simply needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
