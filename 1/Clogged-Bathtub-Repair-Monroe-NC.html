<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
