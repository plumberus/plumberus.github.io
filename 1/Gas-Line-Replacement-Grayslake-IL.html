<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Grayslake IL 60030</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and reinstall locknut. Last but not least, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
