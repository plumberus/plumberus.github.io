<p>Unlike batch feed disposals, continuous feed disposals have no cover on them and they could pose a threat to the hands and fingers, as food is sent out down manually. However, they have shown to be the most effective. Your option depends on what you value the majority of. Overall, the three most important elements for deciding between the two kinds of waste disposers are safety, money, and amount of waste.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the new heater.</p>
