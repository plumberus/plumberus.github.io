<p>Is your drain clogged with hair, particles, or toilet paper? After years of usage, drains can collect damaging build-up. This build-up blocks water circulation, ultimately backing up your drains up until they are unusable. Typically, all the pipes need is a great scrubbing. We can accomplish this through a variety of approaches such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing waste disposal unit, or too much food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will typically suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting Â® services, depending on the severity of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells nasty, or is slow to drain.</p>
