<p>Is your drain clogged with hair, particles, or toilet paper? After years of usage, drains can collect damaging build-up. This build-up blocks water circulation, ultimately backing up your drains up until they are unusable. Typically, all the pipes need is a great scrubbing. We can accomplish this through a variety of approaches such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
