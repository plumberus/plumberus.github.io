In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
