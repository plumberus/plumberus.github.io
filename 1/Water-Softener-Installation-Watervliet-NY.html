<p>Dual Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Double Examine Valve or double backflow prevention valve is basically a disrobed Double Check Valve without shut off valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are normally used by water companies and installed after a water meter to avoid the meter from running backwards and low protection against backflow. This piece of equipment is the center of debate with numerous backflow authorities and should never be confused with Double Check Valves.

<p>This is another combination that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can duplicate this process. Galvanized steel pipes are perfect for irrigation and supply of water lines, but they are usually not used in new building and constructions today. It is more likely to be found in older homes constructed prior to the 1970s.</p>
<p>There are cracks in the porcelain. It can lead to a leak if you see hairline or larger fractures developing in the bowl or tank of your toilet.

<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may need a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on homes change that may require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your service, they can cause monetary losses and in some instances can stop your organisation entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little office the concerns triggered by even small drain problems can trigger major issues.</p>
<p>Testing need to be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor should possess a legitimate, updated plumbing license, present insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently calibrated test set. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
