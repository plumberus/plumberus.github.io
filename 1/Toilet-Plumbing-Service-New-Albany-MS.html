<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Rust can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer. If the part is functional or should be replaced, the effect of deterioration on a metal alloy must be evaluated to figure out.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
