<p>Every day, the drains in your home successfully eliminate large amounts of water and waste. With time, dirt, particles, hair, and numerous other little particles can get caught and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this takes place.</p>

The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
