<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
