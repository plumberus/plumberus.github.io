<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need.

Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
