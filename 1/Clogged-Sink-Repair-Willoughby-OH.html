<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe supply of water system. Due to the fact that they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are generally preferred. Other great choices are overload protection, which switches off the motor if it starts to get too hot; an auto-reverse function to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty meals get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal particularly developed to be used with a septic system. gives a summary 1 of waste disposal unit and septic tanks.</p>
