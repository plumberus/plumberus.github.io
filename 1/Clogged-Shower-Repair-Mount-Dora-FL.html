<p>Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs in time. Sanford & Son plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily imply they need to be changed if your pipes are older than these guidelines. Well-kept pipes may last longer, and improperly kept ones or those in areas with tough water (meaning it has high mineral content), might fail sooner, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life-span estimates.</p>
