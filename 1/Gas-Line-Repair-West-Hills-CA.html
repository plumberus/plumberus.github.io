<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor West Hills CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Another method to handle a clog is by utilizing a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they may be too severe on your pipes, you can attempt old home remedies like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda. If you have actually attempted everything and the clog stays, call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and ask about our clogged toilet repair service.
