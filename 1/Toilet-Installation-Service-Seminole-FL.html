<p>If you're living with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless appliance repair costs, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not a problem that will disappear by itself and the costs incurred by tough water will just continue to intensify.

If scale continues to collect in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout your home. Tough water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your energy expenses will continue to barrel skyward. If your water supply is hard, the continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue up until your house is protected by a water softener.</p>
