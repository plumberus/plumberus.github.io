<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each part. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
