<p>The issue of leakage can be attributed to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal growth needs to leave, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the expansion occurring when boiling the water causes the tank to crack and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
