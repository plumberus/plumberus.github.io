Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should likewise be provided.</p>
