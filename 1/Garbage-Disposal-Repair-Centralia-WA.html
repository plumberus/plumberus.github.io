Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet package.</p>
<p>Stop work orders will be used to stop work that is determined to be contrary to arrangements of the Uniform Code, or is being carried out in a risky or dangerous way, or is being carried out without obtaining a needed license. A stop work order will specify the reason for its issuance and the conditions which need to be satisfied prior to work will be permitted to resume.</p>
