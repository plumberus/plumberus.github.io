<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) as soon as you've found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
