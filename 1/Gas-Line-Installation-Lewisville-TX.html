<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Lewisville TX 75067</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
