<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Storm Lake IA 50588</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific process, but easy to fix. It uses salt to eliminate smells and minerals found in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
