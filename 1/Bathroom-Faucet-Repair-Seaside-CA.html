<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can develop noise. If your energy expenses are increasing, a new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them back down.

After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new place and put there.</p>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be treated easily if the obstruction is shallow and simple.

As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
