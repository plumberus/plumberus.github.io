<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it could wreak undesirable issues on your home. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
