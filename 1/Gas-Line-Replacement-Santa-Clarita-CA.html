One thing to know about gas lines is they can be extremely unsafe if there is a leak. While gas leakages are rare, you need to leave the structure immediately if you discover a smell like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have nearly instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be deadly. If you have actually got a gas pipe leaking, get out of your home and call us right away.</p>
<p>Check to ensure it's not your garbage disposal that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to make sure it's running properly. You might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the system underneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
