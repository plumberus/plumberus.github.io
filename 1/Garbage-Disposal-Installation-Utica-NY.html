<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
