<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you pick must be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>

According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The mean per capita water use daily is greater in rural counties than urban counties in all the climate areas, except in the Central and Southeast areas"1 with rural areas having less effective supply of water systems2 mainly due to the relative lack of financial resources to update and maintain their systems.
