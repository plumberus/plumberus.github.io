<p>Guaranteeing plumbing devices such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are separated to their own respective networks is crucial in order to maintain safe and clean water safety.

Again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be one of the most costly repair tasks if overlooked. For instance, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a problem, you might need all of your water piping replaced. Once again, really costly. This is simply one of lots of problems that can surface.</p>
<p>Another duty of the Plumbing Division is to perform cross connection inspections to determine potable water systems that are in need of being protected from contaminates.
