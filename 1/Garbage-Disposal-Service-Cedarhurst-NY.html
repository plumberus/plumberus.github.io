<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Cedarhurst NY</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
