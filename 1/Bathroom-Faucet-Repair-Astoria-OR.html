<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

Whether you require assist with a minor repair, a re-pipe or a remodel, you can ensure that the work will be completed the first time accurately.
