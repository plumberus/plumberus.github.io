<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using equipment from bad efficiency and premature failure. Some tough water problems are extremely noticeable, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Unnoticeable or visible, these problems have actually real costs connected with them. Clogged components trigger replacement or reconditioning expenses and can frustrate your consumers. Scale buildup in your hot water heater will inflate your energy bills, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
