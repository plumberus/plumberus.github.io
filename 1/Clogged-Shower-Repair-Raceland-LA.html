<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the more affordable and better long-lasting service if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>This short article aims to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive.

Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, best? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
