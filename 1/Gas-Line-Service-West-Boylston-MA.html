<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
