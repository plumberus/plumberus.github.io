For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
