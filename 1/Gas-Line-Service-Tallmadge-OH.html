<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
