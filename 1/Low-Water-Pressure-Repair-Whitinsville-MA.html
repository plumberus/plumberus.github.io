For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>

Deterioration can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or change the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.
