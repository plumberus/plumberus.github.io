These cameras are developed to go through weaves due to their bend, and their real-time transmission offers definitive proof of the problem.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
