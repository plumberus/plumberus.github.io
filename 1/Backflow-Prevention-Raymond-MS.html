<p>Instead of drudging large trenches to access your underground sewer system, Roto-Rooter service technicians will drill just a few holes to see where the sewer line problem is and resolve it rapidly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal choice for your home or service. The other distinction in between constant feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not at one time like a continuous feed garbage disposal.</p>
