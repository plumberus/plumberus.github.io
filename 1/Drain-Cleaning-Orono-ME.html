<p>Leaks are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
