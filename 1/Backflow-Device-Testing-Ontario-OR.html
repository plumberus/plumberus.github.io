Water temperature level concerns can be fixed by adjusting the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method.</p>
