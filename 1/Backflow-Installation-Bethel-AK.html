<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
