<p>There are certain plumbers who specialize in plumbing related to house remodeling and new building and construction.

<p>Inspecting the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak someplace and this might be major problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your home should have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working properly, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
