<p>In the 1990 â€² s, dry spell conditions inspired water providers to implement water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in houses were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has actually become a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has the power needed to efficiently remove waste with each flush.</p>
