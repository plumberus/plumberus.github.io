Appropriate drainage should likewise be supplied.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
