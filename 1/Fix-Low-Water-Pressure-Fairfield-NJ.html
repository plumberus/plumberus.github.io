<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is delicate to water pressure and depends on a good balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being frustrating, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the home and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, damp bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your last expenses.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
