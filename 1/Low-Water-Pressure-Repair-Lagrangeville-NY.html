<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a great indication, a weird gurgling noise. Don't depend on a plunger to remedy the issue-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair.

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
