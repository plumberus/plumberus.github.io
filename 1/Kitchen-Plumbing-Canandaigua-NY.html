<h3>Blocked Drains in Canandaigua New York</h2>
<p>Many house owners will notice a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical may finish the job, it's in fact quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners typically use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is developed to eat through obstructions and liquify them, but it also penetrates your pipes and produces weak spots that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
<p>While some problems can merely be fixed, others require a full replacement. If your toilet bowl is broken or leaking, or if the valve assembly is shot, toilet replacement is the best option for your issue. Our plumbers have years of experience replacing toilets in the Baltimore County area and will guarantee that your new toilet will be set up correctly so that it doesn't move or leak.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>
