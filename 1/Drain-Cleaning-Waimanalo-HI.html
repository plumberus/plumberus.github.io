A standard tank hot water heater usually lasts anywhere from 8-12 years prior to needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last as much as 20 with proper maintenance and care.

If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working appropriately.</p>
