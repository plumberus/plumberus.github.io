Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.

Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
