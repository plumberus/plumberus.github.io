<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our presentation. The actions for replacing a propane water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
