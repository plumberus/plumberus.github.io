If you're aiming to save on energy costs and would like warm water on demand, consider a tankless hot water heater. These systems require less maintenance and last longer (over 20 years) than the traditional water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless electrical water heaters can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are powerful and big enough to provide hot water to all restrooms, kitchen areas, and home appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that supply warm water to specific rooms or home appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same method. The only difference is the quantity of water they can warm up at any given time. Likewise, whole-house units are significantly more costly than the point of usage units.</p>
