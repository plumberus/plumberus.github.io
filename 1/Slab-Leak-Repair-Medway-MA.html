<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
