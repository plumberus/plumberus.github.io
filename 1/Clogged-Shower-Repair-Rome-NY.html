Instead of dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
