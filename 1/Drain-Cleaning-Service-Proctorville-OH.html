You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water supply.</p>
