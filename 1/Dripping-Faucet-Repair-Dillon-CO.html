<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
