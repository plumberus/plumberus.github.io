<p>Sinkholes don't just happen in your yard, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out rapidly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your home's structure.

In this case, you'll need professional plumbers as well as foundation repair professionals.</p>

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
