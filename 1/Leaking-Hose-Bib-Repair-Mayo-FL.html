<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Mayo FL</h3>
<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to warm the water. Things get worse considerably for homes with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>
