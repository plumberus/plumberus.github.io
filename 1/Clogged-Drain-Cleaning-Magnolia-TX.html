<p>The typical time to replace a garbage or install disposal varies from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour. The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or nasty smell to it. When the piping in your house begins to show any of these indications of rust, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>
