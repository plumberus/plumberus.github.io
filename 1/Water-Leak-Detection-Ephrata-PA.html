<p>As soon as you have actually discovered the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
