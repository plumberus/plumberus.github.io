The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply adequate flow.</p>
<p>You rely on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are triggering major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
