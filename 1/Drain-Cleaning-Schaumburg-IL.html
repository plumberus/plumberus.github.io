<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to split and solidify or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak.
