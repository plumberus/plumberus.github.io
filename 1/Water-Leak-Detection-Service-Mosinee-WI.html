<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Mosinee WI</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
