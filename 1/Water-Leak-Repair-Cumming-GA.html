<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Cumming GA</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>The law also requires annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can cause charges and termination of water service.
