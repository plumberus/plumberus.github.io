<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
