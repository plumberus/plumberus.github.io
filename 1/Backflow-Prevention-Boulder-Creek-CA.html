<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Bad Smells - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not correctly draining water. Unpleasant stinks are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up builds up, it can cause stronger smells, and more serious piping issues. Without functional draining, excessive pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak leading to costly water damage.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
