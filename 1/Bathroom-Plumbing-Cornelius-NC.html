<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
