<p>This is another mix that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Since water contamination could posture a major public health threat, local laws require yearly inspections to ensure your backflow prevention devices are working as they need to be. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that break with time and it is necessary that they receivethe very same routine maintenance that your car or HVAC system gets to ensure your family's water is clean & safe.</p>
