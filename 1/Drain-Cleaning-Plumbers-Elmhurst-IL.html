<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
