A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
