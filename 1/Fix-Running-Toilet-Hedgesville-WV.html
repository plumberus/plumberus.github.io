<p>Looking to repair or replace your garbage disposal? Lots of obstructions are brought on by putting too much toilet tissue into the bowl. Know just how much toilet paper your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never position any paper item into the toilet bowl aside from toilet tissue. Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drain. Feminine health products need to be disposed of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
