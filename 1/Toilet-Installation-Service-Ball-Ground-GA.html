<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again important for the repair professional to be aware of the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to minimize any scale growth or deterioration. It is necessary that the repair specialist is sensitive to the solidity and kind of the different coatings used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>
