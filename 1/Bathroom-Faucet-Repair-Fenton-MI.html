<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>If you turn on your house's water spigots and water starts draining with a yellowish, reddish or brownish tint, that's a clear indication that rust or sediment has built up in your pipes and a repiping job must be in your future.
