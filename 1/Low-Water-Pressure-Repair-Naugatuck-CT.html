<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
