<h3>Types Of Blocked Drain Cleaning Equipment at Covington GA 30016</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
