<p>Discover the ideal water softener for you. One common way for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue could spread significantly. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
