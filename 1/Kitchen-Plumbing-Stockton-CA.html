The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so deadly that anybody who inhales it needs instant medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 individuals passed away from carbon monoxide poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this disaster, ensure to use your gas stoves exactly as advised and never ever to use them to heat your house.
