You may want to put a container under the trap to capture any wastewater sitting in the bottom. Regular maintenance can help avoid water heater failure and extend the life of your devices.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
