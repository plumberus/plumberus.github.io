<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating appropriately. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
