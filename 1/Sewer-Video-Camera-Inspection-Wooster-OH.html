Black iron pipe is, put simply, the exact same thing, however without the zinc finish. The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, in time, it still does corrode. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Toilet repair tends to freak most people out a little, which is entirely understandable. Nobody wishes to unintentionally break something that could flood their bathroom with raw sewage. Nevertheless, the majority of toilet repairs are basic and straightforward tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes. The most typical concern we run into regarding toilet repair is how to find the ideal parts for your toilet. Sometimes this is simple, and often it's not. Mostly it's simple though.</p>
