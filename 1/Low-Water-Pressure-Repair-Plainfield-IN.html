The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health hazard conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>

Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
