<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be assessed. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might result in incorrect data on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that could harm components. The impacts of raised temperature level can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the components. These and other negative effects from the hydraulic conditions must be recognized and their cause fixed. The brand-new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected.</p>
