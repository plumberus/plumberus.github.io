<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater replacement, maintenance or repair, you can anticipate professional service from skilled plumbing experts. Backflow prevention devices run by permitting water to stream in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the potable water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is needed where the end user presents a risk of polluting the city's water system.</p>
