Backflow prevention devices run by permitting water to stream in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the potable water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is needed where the end user presents a risk of polluting the city's water system.</p>
