<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Havana Florida</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and private on-site water supply and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of defense for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
