Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
