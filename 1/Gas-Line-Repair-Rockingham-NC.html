<p>We're changing a gas water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a propane hot water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Repeating repairs and leakages. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

But first link the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and check for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut up until you've done these last checks lets you easily remove and reset the toilet if you find any problems.</p>
