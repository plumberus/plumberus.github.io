<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation issues or perhaps stop a component from streaming entirely.

<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water turned off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your everyday routine. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furnishings to protect them from dust and particles. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and then remove and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible intact.</p>
