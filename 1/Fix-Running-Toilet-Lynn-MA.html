<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the salt ions.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific process, but simple to correct. It utilizes salt to get rid of odors and minerals discovered in tough water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and attract sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
