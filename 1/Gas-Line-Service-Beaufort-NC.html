<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Beaufort NC</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
