<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies should be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure correct backflow prevention remains in place to protect our drinking water throughout the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing pointer notice one month before the annual test is due.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
