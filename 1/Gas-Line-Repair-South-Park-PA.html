Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
