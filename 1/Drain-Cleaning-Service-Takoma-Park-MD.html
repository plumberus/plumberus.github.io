For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated properly using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
