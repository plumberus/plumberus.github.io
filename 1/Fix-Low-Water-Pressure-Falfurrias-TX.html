<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
