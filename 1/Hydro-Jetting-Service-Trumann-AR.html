When you experience obstructions in several drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>

When this takes place, house owners and plumbers should be able to clear out their drainage pipes. Structures without enough cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at danger of a pipe bursting.</p>
