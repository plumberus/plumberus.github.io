<p>A Pilot Light That Has Actually Headed out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas water heater rather than a system with an electric heating component, there is a great chance your pilot burner has gone out.

Despite what the problem is, however, your water heater will not have the ability to operate until the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>

All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling difficult water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its brand-new place and positioned there.</p>
