When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-lasting service.</p>
<p>Repiping a house takes 3 to 5 days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work.

<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
