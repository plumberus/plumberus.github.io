<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
