<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
