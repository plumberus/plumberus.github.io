Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up.

A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely broken and simply requires to be replaced.</p>
