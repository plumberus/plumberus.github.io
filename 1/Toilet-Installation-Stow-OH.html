<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

Here's how to assess your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
