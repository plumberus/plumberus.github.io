<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
