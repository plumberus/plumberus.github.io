<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to become a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
