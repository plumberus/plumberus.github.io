The cost differs, depending on the kind of material and size of your house. We are happy to offer estimates for entire home pipe replacement and financing choices are readily available for big tasks. A pressure vacuum breaker carries out the very same function as an atmospheric vacuum breaker, but requires just one system to protect the whole water supply when installed on the main water line.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

And these differences determine the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
