<p>When a plumbing authorization has been released in mistake since of inaccurate, insufficient or unreliable details, or the work for which the permit was provided breaches the Uniform Code, such license shall be withdrawed or suspended until such time as the license holder shows that all work completed and all work proposed shall remain in compliance with suitable provisions of the code.</p>
