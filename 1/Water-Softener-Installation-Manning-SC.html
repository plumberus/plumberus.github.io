<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Manning SC</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
