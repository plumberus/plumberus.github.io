<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Pacific Palisades CA</h3>
<p>When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
