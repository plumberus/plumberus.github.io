<h3>When To Call A Plumber Fairfax Station VA</h3>
<p>A complete plumbing inspection with one of Costs Howe's expert technicians will typically last about one hour and will be an extensive introduction of all visual plumbing. Clients buying a brand-new home or experiencing regular sewer backups might want to purchase an additional pipeline camera inspection to have a total understanding of the condition of the houses plumbing and main drain line.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place.
