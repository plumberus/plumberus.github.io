<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to restore and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
