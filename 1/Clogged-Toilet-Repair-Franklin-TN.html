<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
