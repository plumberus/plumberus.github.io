<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Napa CA 94558?</h3>
<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
