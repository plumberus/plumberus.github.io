<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is highly suggested for either community or well water materials. Nobody wishes to walk into a bathroom or a kitchen and find a sink full of black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be operating properly in order to support safe and sanitary living conditions also.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
