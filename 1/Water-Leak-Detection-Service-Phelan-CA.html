<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some homes were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the house. Normally, the water supply to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>

Other benefits you will see include brighter colors in your clothing, decreased scale accumulation on your showers and softer skin.</p>
