Cleaners need to be utilized according to producer guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
