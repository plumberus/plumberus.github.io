<p>When a large enough source of water has been determined and evaluated, the third significant component of a water supply system comes into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Many large cities need several aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>
