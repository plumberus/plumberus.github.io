<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
