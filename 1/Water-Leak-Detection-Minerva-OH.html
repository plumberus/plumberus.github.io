<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be happier with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are extremely experienced, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would certainly recommend them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were wonderful. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, similar to each person we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and very educated. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either little or large task plumbing work.</p>
