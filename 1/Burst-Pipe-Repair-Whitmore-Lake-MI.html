<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
