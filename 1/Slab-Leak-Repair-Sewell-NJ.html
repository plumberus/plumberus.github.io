Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
