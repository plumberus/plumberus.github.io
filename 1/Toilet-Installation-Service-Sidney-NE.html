Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of defense. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, however closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect method. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.
