<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Archer FL</h3>
<p>The standard work week for plumbers is 40 hours (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). As with many careers in construction, there are peak periods that will need you to work overtime. The variety of additional hours you work every week depends upon the building sector and area you work in, and will differ from one task to the next. Gradually, the limescale buildup triggered by difficult water can cause costly plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help prevent premature wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
