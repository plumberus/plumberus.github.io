When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line.

No, it is not a regular incident, but it does occur more often than you believe! Typically it takes place during the night when you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems.
