If your energy expenses are rising, a new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing tough water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new area and put there.</p>

The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
