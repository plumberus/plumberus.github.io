<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters should have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Location a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.

Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only viable option.</p>
