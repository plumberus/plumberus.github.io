Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, without any indications of leakage, you can probably leave it in location. Opportunities are good that the installing brackets on the new system will fit just fine. To learn, remove the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange.</p>
