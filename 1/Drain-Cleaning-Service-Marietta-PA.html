<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you have actually found the journey lever you want remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've secured the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
