<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
<p>Our whole home water softener systems are going to make your skin and hair feel much better after getting out of the shower. The high mineral content of hard water leaves a layer of soap remnants on your skin. This triggers your body to feel itchy and the pores on your face to clog up. A water softener will also help rejuvenate your hair. The minerals in hard water really pull natural oils from your hair and scalp, triggering your head to feel dry. Feel much better in your own skin by enhancing your house's water-- browse our selection of water softening solutions.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
