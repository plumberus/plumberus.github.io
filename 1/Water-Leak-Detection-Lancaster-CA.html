<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
