<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its normal flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is created to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "typical," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water entering the safe and clean water circulation system.</p>
<p>Gas leaks are typically discovered at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that allows connections and disconnections of gas home appliances. A quick way to find a gas leak is if you apply liquid dish soap to the believed area. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and should right away call a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair.</p>
