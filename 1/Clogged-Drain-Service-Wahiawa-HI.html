<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

Usually, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
