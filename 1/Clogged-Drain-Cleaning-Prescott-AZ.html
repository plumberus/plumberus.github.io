<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and solidify or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals.

Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
