We now have cleaned up and checked the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the components to be eliminated in a particular order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each component is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the right location. It is also essential that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the elements or unintentionally positioned in the body. The components need to be put so that the guides are able to keep their created tolerances.</p>
