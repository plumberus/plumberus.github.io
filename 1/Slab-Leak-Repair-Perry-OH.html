<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
