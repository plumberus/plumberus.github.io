<p>When you depend on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair, maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from knowledgeable plumbing specialists. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a structure or fixture.

For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might stream backwards into the potable water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is required where the end user poses a risk of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
