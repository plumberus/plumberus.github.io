<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
