<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers become frustrating, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the house and the number of restrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be regulated to keep the system healthy. When uncontrolled water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is A LOT MORE economical than mold removal or changing flooring or drywall! So we suggest installing or repairing water pressure regulators to protect your entire house.</p>
