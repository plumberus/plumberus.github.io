<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
