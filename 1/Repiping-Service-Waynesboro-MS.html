In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or deterioration. It is very important that the repair professional is delicate to the firmness and type of the various finishings used on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective coating.</p>

At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use.
