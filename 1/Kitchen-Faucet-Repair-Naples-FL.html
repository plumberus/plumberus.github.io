Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>This short article aims to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a correctly configured water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a few confusing facts that frequently lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is typically corrosive.
