<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is proud to use Bio-Clean items for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both harmless to your plumbing and extremely efficient at removing gunk, waste, and natural product that so frequently blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partly repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for natural material and gnaw at it, creating harmless by-products of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are quickly treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>When you encounter a plumbing issue it might be a small leak or a more major scenario. If you have an issue with the sewer line it is a really serious problem that needs instant attention.  The sewer line is the pipe that connects your home to the outdoors sewer system. It is responsible for managing all of the drainage from your house from your toilets, sinks and other appliances. If the sewer pipe becomes broken or bursts, it can trigger an important problem in your house. You'll need to call a plumber for sewer line repair in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes beginning to show signs of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair specific sections in your home or office the same day. As with employing a plumber for simple repairs, you or your contractor must ask for proof of a license and license number. Also verify that workers' payment and liability insurance policies are active.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little interruption to your everyday routine. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furnishings to protect them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and then eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure material as possible intact.</p>
