Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

These devices are often combined into single products to increase their efficiency, such as double check valve assemblies (including two consecutive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located in between them to dispose out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
