<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
