Depending upon the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
