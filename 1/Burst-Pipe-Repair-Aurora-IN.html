An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
