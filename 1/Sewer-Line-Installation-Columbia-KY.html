<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Columbia KY</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The highly hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply.

When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water supply.</p>
