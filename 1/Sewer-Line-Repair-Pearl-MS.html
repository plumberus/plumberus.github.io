<p>Discover the best water softener for you. One typical way for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health danger if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up.
