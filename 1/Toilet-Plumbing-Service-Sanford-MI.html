<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the local system, it's still smart to generate the specialists to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
<p>Be aware that many kinds of disposals need a switch adjacent to the sink to control the outlet-- the electrician should wire for this, too. Keep in mind: Batch-feed disposers do not require a switch because they start when you insert and turn an unique drain plug. The function of the plumbing code is to insure the appropriate installation of systems for providing drinkable water, for sanitary sewage disposal and storm drainage; and to insure public security, health, and well-being insofar as impacted by the installation of plumbing.</p>
