The policy was not strictly implemented up until a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that includes regular random inspections of New york city City structures to ensure they are in compliance.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
