Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
