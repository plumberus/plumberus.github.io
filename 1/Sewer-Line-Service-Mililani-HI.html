<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
