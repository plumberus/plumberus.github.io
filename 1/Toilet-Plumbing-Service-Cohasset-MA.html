<p>Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
