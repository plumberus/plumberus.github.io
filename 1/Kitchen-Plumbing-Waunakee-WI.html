<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include device wires attached, and others do not. Remove the cover plate below the disposal and attach the wires according the producer's directions if yours does not. The majority of standard disposals have you connect white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're completed.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to remove high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause hard water. The system filters out these difficult water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water flows through a Water Softener. State certified backflow specialists, readily available through your turf watering company or plumber can figure out whether or not your devices fulfills the requirements. The guidelines also need a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer annually.</p>
