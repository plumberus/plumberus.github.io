<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Mystic CT</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-term service if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
