<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Mattoon IL 61938?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
