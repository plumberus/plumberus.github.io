Bio-Clean is an all-natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and extremely effective at getting rid of grime, waste, and natural material that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partly fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively seek out natural material and eat away at it, developing harmless byproducts of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
