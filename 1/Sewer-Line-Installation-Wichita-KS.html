<p>Remember that a quote see does not obligate you to choose that company. If the plumber that comes out provides you the heebie-jeebies or seems fly-by-night, call out the next company. You're trying to find a company that you can put on speed dial for any plumbing problem, so it needs to be a company of people that you have an excellent, solid feeling about.</p>

If left ignored, they can also end up being the most hazardous and harmful.</p>
