Repeating repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As an outcome, we suggest changing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Another threat that can result from the improper or bad installation of a gas line or device is an increase carbon monoxide levels in your house. Due to the fact that it is unsavory and odor-free although it is extremely toxic, it is hard to discover carbon monoxide.

Additionally, you could install carbon monoxide gas detectors in your house.</p>
