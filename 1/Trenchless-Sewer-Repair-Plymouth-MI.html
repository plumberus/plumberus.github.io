<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
