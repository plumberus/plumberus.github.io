<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.

Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
