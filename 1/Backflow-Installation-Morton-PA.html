<h3>Blocked Drains in Morton PA 19070 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Replaced 50 gallon electric hot water heater, thermal growth tank, and pressure regulator valve. When most people consider plumbers, they typically call them for pipes issues. The gas plumber will have a license that states she or he is licensed to deal with and install natural gas lines. House owners ought to consider whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which represents a high degree of experience, certifications and understanding.</p>
<p>The concern of leakage can be credited to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal growth needs to get away, hence the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
