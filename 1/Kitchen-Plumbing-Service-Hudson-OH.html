Keep in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
