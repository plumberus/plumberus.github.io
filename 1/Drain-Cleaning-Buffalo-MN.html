The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
