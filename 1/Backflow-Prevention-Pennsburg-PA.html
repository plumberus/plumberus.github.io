<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Pennsburg PA 18073?</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>A Pilot burner That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas hot water heater instead of a system with an electric heating aspect, there is a likelihood your pilot light has gone out. This could be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or just a strong breeze. No matter what the problem is, however, your water heater will not be able to work till the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
