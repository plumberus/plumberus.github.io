For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
