<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. Identify the size of the pipes in the house and around the home - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply adequate circulation.</p>
