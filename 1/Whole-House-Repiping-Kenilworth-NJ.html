<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be removed.

The law likewise requires backflow assemblies in commercial establishments such as mortuaries and healthcare facilities, along with commercial centers.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference between them? When it comes to the problem of difficult water, a traditional water softener in fact eliminates silica, calcium and magnesium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is referred to as short-term hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
