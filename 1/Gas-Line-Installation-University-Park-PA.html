Nasty odor: A strong, unpleasant odor coming from your drains could suggest one of two concerns: food congesting the drain, or a bigger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system.
