<p>Once a large adequate source of water has been identified and assessed, the third significant element of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most large cities need several aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
