The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health hazard conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
