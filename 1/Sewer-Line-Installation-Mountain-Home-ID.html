<p>Discover the right water softener for you.

A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific residences, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature device wires connected, and others do not. Remove the cover plate underneath the disposal and connect the wires according the producer's guidelines if yours does not. Many standard disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're finished, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
