<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
