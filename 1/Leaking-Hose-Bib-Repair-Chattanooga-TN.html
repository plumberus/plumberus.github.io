<p>In water system systems, water is usually kept at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

The majority of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that turn up will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might impact the time it takes.
