These gadgets are often combined into single items to increase their effectiveness, such as double check valve assemblies (including 2 successive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located between them to dump out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called rust.
