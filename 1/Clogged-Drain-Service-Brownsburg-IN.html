During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
