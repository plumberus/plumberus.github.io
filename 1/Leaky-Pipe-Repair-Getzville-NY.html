Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
