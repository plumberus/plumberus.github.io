<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
