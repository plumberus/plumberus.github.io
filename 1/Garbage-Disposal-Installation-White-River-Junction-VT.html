<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
