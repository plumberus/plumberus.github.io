<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
