Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage must also be provided.</p>
