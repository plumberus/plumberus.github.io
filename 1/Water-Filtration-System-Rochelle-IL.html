There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that could lead to false data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that might harm components. The effects of elevated temperature can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the parts. These and other unfavorable effects from the hydraulic conditions should be acknowledged and their cause corrected.
