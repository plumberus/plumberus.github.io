If you are not particularly trained to do so, it is never advised that you try to replace a gas or electric water heater. Improper installation of hot water heater might cause fire or explosion.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
