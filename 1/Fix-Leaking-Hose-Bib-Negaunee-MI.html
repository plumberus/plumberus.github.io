<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these issues, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While a few of these problems can be credited to typical wear and tear or incorrect installation, in some cases your garbage disposal ends up being damaged by items that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>In order to avoid your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay close attention to what is being cleaned down your system.
