<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, correctly set up and kept backflow assembly basically gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Ensure that the softener is filled with sodium or potassium chloride following the maker's suggestions.</p>

In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
