This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
