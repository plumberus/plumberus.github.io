<p>This article intends to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated truths that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally corrosive.

<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
