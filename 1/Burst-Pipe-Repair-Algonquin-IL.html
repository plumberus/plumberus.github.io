<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Algonquin IL 60102!</h3>
<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; decrease the structure's energy and water use; minimize waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.
