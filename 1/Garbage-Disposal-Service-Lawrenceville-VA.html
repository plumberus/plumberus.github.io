<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
