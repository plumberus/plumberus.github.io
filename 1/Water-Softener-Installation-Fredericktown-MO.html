The Epa (EPA) states that the average backflow incident takes nearly 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever questioned exactly what is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. But water softeners were created to fight a remarkably common problem: difficult water.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- essentially 2 layers of defense. The device allows water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the structure, however closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way.
