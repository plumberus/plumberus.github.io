<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Glasgow KY 42141</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
