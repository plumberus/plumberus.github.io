<h3>Bathtub Repair in Albany California</h2>
<p>If you're coping with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless device repair costs, you need a water softener. Hard water is not an issue that will go away by itself and the expenses incurred by difficult water will only continue to escalate. With a water softener, devices will inevitably stop working earlier than their expected life-span. Your circulation rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Tough water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. The continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue up until your home is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
