<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me El Mirage AZ</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
