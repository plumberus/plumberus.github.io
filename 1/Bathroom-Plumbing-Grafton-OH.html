<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does take place more often than you think! Often it happens during the night when you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
