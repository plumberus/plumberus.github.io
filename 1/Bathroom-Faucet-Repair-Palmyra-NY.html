<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with device wires attached, and others do not. Remove the cover plate below the disposal and connect the wires according the producer's directions if yours does not. A lot of basic disposals have you attach white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. When you're ended up, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent.
