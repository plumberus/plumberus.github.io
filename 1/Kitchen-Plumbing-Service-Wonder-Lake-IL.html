<p>Plastic pipe remains in wide use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to produce till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and remained in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being increasingly common, with a range of fittings and products utilized.</p>
