<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
