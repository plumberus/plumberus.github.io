<p>The issue of leakage can be attributed to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal growth requires to escape, for this reason the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force exerted by the growth happening when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and start leaking.
