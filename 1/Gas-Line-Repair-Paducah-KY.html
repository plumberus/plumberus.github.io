A more recent, more efficient water heater will save you in repair expenses and energy over time. Old-fashioned water softeners are infamous for causing a spike in the rate of your regular monthly energy costs. Many require big quantities of water and can be pricey for the electrical power bill, however the NuvoH2O system is various. Our saltless H2O conditioning system consumes to 4x less water than others and requires no electrical power.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean.

Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
