In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant clogs: If the plunger has actually become a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages suggest your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully remove waste with each flush.</p>
