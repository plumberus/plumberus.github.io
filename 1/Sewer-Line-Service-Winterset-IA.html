<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Winterset IA 50273!</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
