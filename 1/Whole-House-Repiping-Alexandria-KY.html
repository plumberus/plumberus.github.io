<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.
