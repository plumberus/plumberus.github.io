<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.

Connections that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
