<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment.

Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
