<p>The average cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending upon the size and design. They are much safer to use than constant feed disposals, but are not recommended for homes that create a lot of food waste. Rather of a switch, the batch feed garbage disposal is activated by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating impact on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience far more tear and wear than residential drains and are more susceptible to blockages and obstruction. All backflow preventers must be tested every year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be offered to us.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes beginning to show signs of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair certain sections in your house or workplace the very same day. Similar to hiring a plumber for basic repairs, you or your contractor must request for proof of a license and license number. Also verify that workers' payment and liability insurance policies are active.</p>
<p>You may not recognize how much you depend on your waste disposal unit till it quits working. If your disposal begins making loud sounds or doesn't work at all, it's time to hire a professional. Never ever put yourself at threat of injury by putting your hand in the drain. We have the training and tools to repair or replace the disposal the right way. We'll identify the problem and quickly fix it so you can have a working disposal prior to your next meal.</p>
