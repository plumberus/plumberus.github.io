Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

This can trigger low flow issues or perhaps stop a fixture from flowing completely. The next typical issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it lowers the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
