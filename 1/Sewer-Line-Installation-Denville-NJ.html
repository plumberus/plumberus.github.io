If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Prior to choice and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies should be safeguarded from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly should be used.
