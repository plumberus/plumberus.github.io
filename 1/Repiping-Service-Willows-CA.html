<p>Need loads, no matter what their use, must be fulfilled by an adequately sized water system, which constitutes the 2nd major component of a supply of water system. With appropriate tank capability to satisfy variable peak load demand, the water system source can offer a steady circulation of water. During hours of low demand, the water circulation can be utilized to fill up storage tanks, tanks and towers, which then provide water for emergency use and periods when demand surpasses the baseline pumping rate. A water system source can take numerous types, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
