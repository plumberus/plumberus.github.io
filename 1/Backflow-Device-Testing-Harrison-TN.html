Water solidity, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs across the U.S. from a little tough (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Setting up gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service.
