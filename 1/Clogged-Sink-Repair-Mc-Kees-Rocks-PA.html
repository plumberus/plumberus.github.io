<p>Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up during the designated period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and suggested a tool to be utilized in the future. How do you know if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Watch out for multiple clogged drains in your house, overruning or backed up toilets, or water stains on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
