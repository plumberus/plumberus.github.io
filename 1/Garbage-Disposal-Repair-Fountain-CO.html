<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only remove as much structure product as required to reach, remove, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it.
