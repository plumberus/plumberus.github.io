<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Edinboro PA 16412</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
