<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually accomplished a development in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology.
