<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly operating RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>
