<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Once you have actually discovered the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank.
