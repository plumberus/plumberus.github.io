Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
