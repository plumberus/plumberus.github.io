The exchanged ions are then flushed out of your drain. Toilet service, like toilet repair, is something that everyone tends to delay until it is an emergency. However, there is absolutely nothing that can destroy your days like an out-of-service, leaking toilet or overflowing toilet. With our complimentary estimates, there isn't any reason not to call when your toilet starts showing signs of leaking.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and then every year.</p>
