<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
