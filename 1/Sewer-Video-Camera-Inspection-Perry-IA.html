From getting a brand-new water heater when I initially relocated, to appearing at 10pm due to the fact that a pipe busted in my tub and I had water seeping through my lights.

The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
