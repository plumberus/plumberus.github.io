<p>Camera are among the most important tools in the plumbing company. Identify the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will assist to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to supply sufficient circulation.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. You may need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing information. Inspect the list of state licensing companies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
