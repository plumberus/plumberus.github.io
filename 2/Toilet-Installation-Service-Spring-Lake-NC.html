<p>A water softener gets rid of minerals that create water firmness, one of the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Tough water destroys appliances, leaves cloudy soap scum across kitchen areas and restrooms, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on hard water for their cleaning, cooking, and bathing, water softeners serve a crucial function. A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely destroyed water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue. Buying a water softener saves you cash, energy, and time, and protects your house and your property.</p>
<p>Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be serious problem. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house should have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a great start if everything is working correctly.</p>
