<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
