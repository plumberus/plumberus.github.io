<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>
