<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lombard IL 60148?</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
