<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>

This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
