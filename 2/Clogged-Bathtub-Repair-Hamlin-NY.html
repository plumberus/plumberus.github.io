<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system.

Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
