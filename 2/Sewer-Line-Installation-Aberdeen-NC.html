<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Aberdeen NC 28315</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>Commercial sink plumbing is more intricate than residential bathroom or kitchen sink plumbing. Commercial sinks deal with more water and have a more effective straining system to keep food and other debris out of the plumbing system. In fact, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. Call the specialists at Roto-Rooter if your commercial sinks have a clogged drain. We offer a full range of commercial drain services to help you keep your establishment running efficiently. We offer sink repair, toilet repair, shower repair and can even fix floor drains.</p>
