<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
