<p>You might have heard stories about a hot water heater exploding inside a home or business! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into an unsafe time bomb. The age of your hot water heater. A standard tank water heater normally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last approximately 20 with proper maintenance and care. If your unit is getting up there in age, it may be best for your long-term expenses to replace it now.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
