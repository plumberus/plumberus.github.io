Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The extremely toxic insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system.

When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your home into the water system.</p>
