<p>Installed under the sink, the garbage disposal is indicated for slicing up small bits of waste food.

You might need this details later if you need repairs or there are problems after the initial installation.

<p>The area under your kitchen sink has gotten more crowded over the years. Originally, there would have been a cold and hot water line going up to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless service technicians can treat in-place entire brand-new sections of pipe within your damaged line, by means of little or even pre-existing entry points.</p>

<p>They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I give the company props for calling to upgrade us on the later arrival time.
