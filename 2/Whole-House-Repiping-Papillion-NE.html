<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>

Luckily, all sinks work pretty much the exact same method, and follow the exact same fundamental style. Candu Pros can service sinks from all the major brand names. If you're replacing sink hardware like faucets or drains, your Candu Pro can assist with that, too.</p>
