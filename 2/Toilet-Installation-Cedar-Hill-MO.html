<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health threat if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
