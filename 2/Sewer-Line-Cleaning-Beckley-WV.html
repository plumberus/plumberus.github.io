When you give us a call you can feel confident that your toilet remains in great hands. With over 40 years of plumbing experience under our belt, there isn't much that we haven't seen and that we do not know how to repair or replace effectively.</p>
<p>Offered there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial water heater can be fixed, but is it worth fixing? Only after answering the following concerns should you respond to repair or replace. Do you know the number of years old your hot water heater is? Do you know how many years it's ranked for? Consider replacement rather of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for.</p>

<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
