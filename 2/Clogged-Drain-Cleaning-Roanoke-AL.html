<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground seamless gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your backyard. In that case, measure from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the entire pipe. A garbage disposal will last 10 to 12-years, and many guarantees cover the very first 2 to 5-years. When acquiring a new system, keep this in mind.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
