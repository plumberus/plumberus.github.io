The water in your sink, shower, or toilet drains slowly - This is the most common sign that you've got a drain stoppage. While sluggish draining pipes suggests the drain isn't completely clogged, there's still adequate buildup inside it to stop water and waste from going down easy.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
