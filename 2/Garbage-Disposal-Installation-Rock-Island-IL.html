<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Stop work orders will be used to halt work that is figured out to be contrary to provisions of the Uniform Code, or is being conducted in a unsafe or hazardous  manner, or is being performed without getting a needed authorization. A stop work order shall specify the reason for its issuance and the conditions which need to be pleased prior to work will be permitted to resume.</p>
