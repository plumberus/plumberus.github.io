<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
