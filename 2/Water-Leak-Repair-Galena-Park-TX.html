<p>A Pilot burner That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you utilize a gas water heater instead of a system with an electric heating component, there is a likelihood your pilot burner has actually gone out.

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in several drains at once in your house. This can happen in several areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>

Without consistent testing and servicing, these systems can allow contaminated water to flow easily within your supply pipes, developing a serious health threat to building residents. Each backflow prevention system requires various testing procedures and intervals, and demands substantial experience and knowledge.</p>
