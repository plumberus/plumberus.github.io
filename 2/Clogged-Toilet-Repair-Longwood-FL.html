<p>Deterioration: The most typical issue is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is particularly true if you have untreated tough water, which contains extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is tough to repair. Leaks often mean a new unit replacement is in order.</p>

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
