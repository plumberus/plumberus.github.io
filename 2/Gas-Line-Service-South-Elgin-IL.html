<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes South Elgin IL</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. A little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the new line during installation. Less parts in the unit lead to less tankless water heater repair appointments.</p>
