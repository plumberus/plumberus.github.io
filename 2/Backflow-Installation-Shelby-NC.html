These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>Buy a borax replacement water softer in the EU and it's enormously likely you will be buying a box of salt sesquicarbonate - Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2 WATER.
