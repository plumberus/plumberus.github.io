<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really pricey alternative.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position.
