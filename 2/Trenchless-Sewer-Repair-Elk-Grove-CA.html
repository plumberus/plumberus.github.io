<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Elk Grove CA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
