<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Alhambra CA</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may appear like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners may be a low-cost solution, the severe ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, with time, creating weak spots in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The extremely harmful insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company staff member had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water system.</p>

<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
