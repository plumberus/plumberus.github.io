This can trigger low flow concerns and even stop a fixture from flowing altogether. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it reduces the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
