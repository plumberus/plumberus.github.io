<p>Leak detection belongs of water conservation that depends on extremely technical knowledge and specific devices to determine the location of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the place of those leaks at which visible water might or may not have emerged.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
