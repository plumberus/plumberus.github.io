<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
