<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
