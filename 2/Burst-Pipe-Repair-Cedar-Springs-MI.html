<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
