<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
