<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials.

PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair professional to be knowledgeable about the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to minimize any scale growth or deterioration. It is necessary that the repair professional is delicate to the firmness and type of the different coatings used on iron body units so as not to damage the protective finish.</p>
