<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Golden Valley AZ 86413 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>From below the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and re-install locknut. Lastly, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Insects. Sadly, a harmed main sewer line can also result in undesirable insects inside your house. Rats and pests can quickly squeeze through fractures and spaces in your sewer line and find their method into your plumbing. These insects can be extremely damaging to your health. If you think you have insects in your plumbing, a plumber can perform a visual inspection of your sewer line.</p>
