Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).
