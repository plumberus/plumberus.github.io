<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
