During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
