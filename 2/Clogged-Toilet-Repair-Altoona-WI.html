<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Corrosion can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. If the part is functional or need to be replaced, the effect of rust on a metal alloy should be evaluated to identify.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
