These flanges are easy and widely offered to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the water system to your home at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation procedure, turned off the supply of water to your house. Make sure your hot water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electricity going to the system.</p>
