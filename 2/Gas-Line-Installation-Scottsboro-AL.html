<p>We're changing a natural gas water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a gas water heater are precisely the very same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Repeating repairs and leakages. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your system if it is over ten years old.</p>
