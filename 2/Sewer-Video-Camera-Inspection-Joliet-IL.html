<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
