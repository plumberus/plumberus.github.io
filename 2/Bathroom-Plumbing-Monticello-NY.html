<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
