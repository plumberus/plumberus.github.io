<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Lanham MD</h3>
<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
