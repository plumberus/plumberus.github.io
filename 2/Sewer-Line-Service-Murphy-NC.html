<h3>You Can Save Money With Water Leak Detection in Murphy NC 28906</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
