<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are developed to allow the parts to be removed for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not required for the most part. Some components such as relief valve bodies might need to be removed from the main body to facilitate a repair. Knowing the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
