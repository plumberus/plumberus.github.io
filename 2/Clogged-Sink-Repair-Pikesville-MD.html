Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
