The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health risk or health hazard conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect versus back siphonage.</p>
