<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does occur more frequently than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Every day you rely on your hot water heater more than you might even recognize. From washing your face, brushing your teeth, and showering, to doing kitchen chores like washing meals, warm water is a necessity. If you own a commercial residential or commercial property or service, it can cause a substantial disturbance in your business operations if your water heating equipment stops working.</p>
