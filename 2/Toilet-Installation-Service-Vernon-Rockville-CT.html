<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes.

<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it typically ends up being destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time.
