<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not advised, as this could clog the softening tank. It is suggested that you permit your unit to go empty of one kind of salt prior to adding another to avoid the incident of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a license. And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Tough water shortens the life expectancy of many major appliances and systems in your house due to the amount of limescale and sediment accumulation that takes place. Limescale on pipes can trigger rust and obstructions, which not just reduces the life expectancy of the pipes but puts you in a position where you may need to spend for a costly repair. Accumulation in pipes can also lead to an increase of water pressure, which can damage the whole sewer system and considerably increase the opportunities of a pipe breaking due to stress.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to get rid of high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that trigger hard water. The system filters out these difficult water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water flows through a Water Softener. State certified backflow service technicians, offered through your turf irrigation company or plumber can figure out whether or not your equipment fulfills the requirements. The policies also require a state certified backflow professional test the backflow preventer each year.</p>
