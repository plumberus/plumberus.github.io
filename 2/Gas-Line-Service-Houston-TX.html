<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
