<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
