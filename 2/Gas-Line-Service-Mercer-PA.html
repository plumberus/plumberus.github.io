<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
