<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>That said, you don't always need to drain 10s of thousands of dollars on repairing your house's pipe or sewer lines.
