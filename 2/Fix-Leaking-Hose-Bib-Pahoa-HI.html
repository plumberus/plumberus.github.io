<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. Identify the size of the water pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the house. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to offer appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again important for the repair specialist to be knowledgeable about the firmness of the products so that their cleaning procedure is not destructive. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or corrosion. It is important that the repair specialist is delicate to the hardness and type of the various finishings utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>
