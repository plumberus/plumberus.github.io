The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to offer appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or corrosion. It is important that the repair specialist is delicate to the hardness and type of the various finishings utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>
