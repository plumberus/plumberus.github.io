<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite.

Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
