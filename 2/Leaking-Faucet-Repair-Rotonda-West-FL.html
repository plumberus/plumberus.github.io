<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
