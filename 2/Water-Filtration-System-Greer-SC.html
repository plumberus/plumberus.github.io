<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Greer SC</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are normally located behind the sink, in confined areas. The best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much area and need a broad swing angle, which may be tough to acquire in little areas.</p>
