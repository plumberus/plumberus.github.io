<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on holiday throughout the time of repair and it was soothing to know it had actually been looked after and all set to go upon our return. For a plumber concentrating on drain-clearing services, expect to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. A lot of problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the hourly rate.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and reinstall locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
