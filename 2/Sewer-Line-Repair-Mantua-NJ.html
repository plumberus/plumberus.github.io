<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.
