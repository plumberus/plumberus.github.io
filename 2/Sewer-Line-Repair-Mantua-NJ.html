<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water system.</p>
