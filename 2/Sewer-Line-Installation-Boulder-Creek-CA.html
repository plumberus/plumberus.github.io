If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a prompt manner, the chances are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared detergent dosage, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if firmness had an effect on detergent savings. The research study included tests that eliminated hard soils, in addition to examining identifying and shooting. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes nearly 30% less cleaning agent, however cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that detergent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>
