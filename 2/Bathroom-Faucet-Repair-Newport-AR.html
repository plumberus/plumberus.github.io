<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, a special type of black pipe need to be utilized that is coated with an unique plastic material that keeps the moisture out. This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and also since the plastic covering actually secures the pipe much better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
