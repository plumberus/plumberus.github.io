<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Plainview NY</h3>

When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to return to the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water supply.</p>
