<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
