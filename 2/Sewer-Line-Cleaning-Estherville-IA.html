<p>You can also depend upon water softeners to decrease your daily operating costs by saving cleaning agent and allowing you to utilize lower water temperature levels while preserving a top quality wash.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
