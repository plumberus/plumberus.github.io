<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
