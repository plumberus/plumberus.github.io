<p>A Pilot burner That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas water heater instead of a system with an electric heating aspect, there is a great chance your pilot burner has headed out. This could be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or merely a strong breeze. Despite what the concern is, however, your water heater will not be able to work until the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can create noise. If your energy expenses are increasing, a new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, permitting hard water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new area and positioned there.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
