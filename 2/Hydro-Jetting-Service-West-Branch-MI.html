<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in West Branch MI 48661</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, odor, color or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complex issues with water temperature level or pressure may require replacing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three different celebrations, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess. They, as with each person we've encountered with Plumb Crazy, were polite, timely, and really educated. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either large or little task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just eliminate as much building product as required to reach, detach, and remove the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling listed below it. If you wish, you can organize to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>
