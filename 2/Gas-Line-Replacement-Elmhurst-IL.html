<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
