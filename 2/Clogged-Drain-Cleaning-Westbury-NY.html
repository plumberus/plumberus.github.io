<p>From beneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are susceptible to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Deterioration can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer.
