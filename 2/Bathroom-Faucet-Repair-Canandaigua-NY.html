Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
