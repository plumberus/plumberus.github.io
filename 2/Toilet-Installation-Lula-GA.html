<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
