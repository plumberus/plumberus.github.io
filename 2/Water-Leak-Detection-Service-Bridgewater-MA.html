<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide.

If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.
