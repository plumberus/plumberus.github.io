<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Gwynn Oak MD</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers handle all kinds of work. Their responsibilities break out into two categories: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on remodeling additions and jobs.</p>
