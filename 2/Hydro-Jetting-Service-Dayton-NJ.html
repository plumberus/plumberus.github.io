<p>A recently installed water heater need to not produce unusual noises, however it will begin to create rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen dramatically for households with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
