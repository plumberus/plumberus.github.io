<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride.

If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are hiring somebody to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also know the areas to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to recognize.</p>
