<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Chesapeake Beach MD</h3>
<p>A recently installed water heater should not produce weird noises, but it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things intensify dramatically for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
