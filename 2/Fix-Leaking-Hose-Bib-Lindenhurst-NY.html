<p>The typical time to install or replace a garbage disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.

When the piping in your house begins to show any of these indications of corrosion, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>
