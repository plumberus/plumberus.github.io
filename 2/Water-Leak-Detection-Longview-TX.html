<p>Sewer lines have one important role: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly option.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. If your toilet is fairly brand-new, you might need to change bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range.
