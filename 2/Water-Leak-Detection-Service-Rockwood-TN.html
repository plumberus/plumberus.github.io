<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
