<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are designed to permit the components to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed in most cases. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be gotten rid of from the main body to assist in a repair. Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
