I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
