Watering backflow prevention assemblies should be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure proper backflow prevention is in location to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season.

A water softener conserves you from replacing prematurely ruined water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
