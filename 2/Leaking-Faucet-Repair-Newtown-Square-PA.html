<h3>Shower Valve Replacement in Newtown Square Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
