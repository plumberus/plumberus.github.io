<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

Schedule a quote as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>

This is particularly true if you have without treatment hard water, which contains severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the corrosion, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair.
