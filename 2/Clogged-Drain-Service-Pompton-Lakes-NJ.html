<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in locations where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
