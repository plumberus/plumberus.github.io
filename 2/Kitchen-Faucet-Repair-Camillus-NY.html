In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous clogs: If the plunger has actually ended up being a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous obstructions show your toilet no longer has actually the power required to effectively eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
