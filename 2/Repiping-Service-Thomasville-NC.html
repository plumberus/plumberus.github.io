The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both places.

Assemblies not presently noted must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing components in your house? Water pressure in the home resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy. When uncontrolled water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is MUCH more cost-effective than mold removal or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we recommend setting up or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>
