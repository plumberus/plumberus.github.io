<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's an oddly intricate clinical process, but simple to correct. It utilizes salt to get rid of smells and minerals found in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that bring in and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
