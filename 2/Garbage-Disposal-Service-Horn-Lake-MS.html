<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does occur more often than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
