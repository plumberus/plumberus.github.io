<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Fort Campbell KY</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and regular leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term option.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the home is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is FAR MORE cost-effective than mold removal or replacing flooring or drywall! So we recommend setting up or fixing water pressure regulators to safeguard your entire house.</p>
