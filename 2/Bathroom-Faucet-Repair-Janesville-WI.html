<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions.
