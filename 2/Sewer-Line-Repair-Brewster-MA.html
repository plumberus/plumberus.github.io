<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to several kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from rust and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your house. This might not need completely repiping your house, given that newer materials might have currently been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify exactly what work requires to be done.</p>
