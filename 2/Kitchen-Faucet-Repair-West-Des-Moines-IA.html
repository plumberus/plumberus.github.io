<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in West Des Moines IA 50265</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>In addition to clogged drain repair, you can count on Waldrop for leaking drain repair. In time, the material your drain is made of can start to wear away, degrade, and ultimately fracture with normal usage, resulting in a leak.
