<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.

The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
