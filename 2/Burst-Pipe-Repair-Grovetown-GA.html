Remember that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
