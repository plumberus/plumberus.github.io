<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
