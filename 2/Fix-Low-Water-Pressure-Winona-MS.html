<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make certain it works. Examine underneath to be sure there aren't any leakages. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of appropriately.

Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when found and changed with another pipe material.</p>
