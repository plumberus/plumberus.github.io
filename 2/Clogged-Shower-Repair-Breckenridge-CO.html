<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
