<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
