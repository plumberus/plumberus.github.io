<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Cottonwood AZ</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Main sewer repair includes substantial excavation, fortifying supporting walls, relaying and removing pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for temporary cover. Service lines which stem from personal property and feed into the main line are a typical area for leakages or breaks. Off-road jobs outside the right of way require a lot of manual work for excavation and transporting materials, rock, and dirt to and from the site.</p>
