<p>Building codes can differ from city to city, however all serve the very same purpose.

Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
