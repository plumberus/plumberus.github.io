We are now ready to begin the re-assembly process. Some models need the elements to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the appropriate place.
