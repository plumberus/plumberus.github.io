<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies East Rockaway NY</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
