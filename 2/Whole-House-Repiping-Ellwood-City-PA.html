<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
