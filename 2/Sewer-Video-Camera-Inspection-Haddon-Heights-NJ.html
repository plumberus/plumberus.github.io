Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

<p>However is a plumbing disaster impending or simply an issue for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly do not want to do the job before it's needed. When it's time for replacement, here's how to assess your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
