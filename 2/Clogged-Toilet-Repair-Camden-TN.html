<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does happen more often than you believe! Frequently it occurs in the evening when you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>

After a couple of minutes, run warm water down the drain. Inadequate or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually.
