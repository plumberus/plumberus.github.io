<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
