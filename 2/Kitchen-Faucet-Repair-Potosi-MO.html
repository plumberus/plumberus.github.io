<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening tank. It is recommended that you permit your system to go empty of one type of salt prior to including another to prevent the event of any problems.

The system ends up being weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Because they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
