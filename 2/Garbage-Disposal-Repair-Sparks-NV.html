<p>The typical option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
