At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
