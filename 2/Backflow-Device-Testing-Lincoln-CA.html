If scale continues to accumulate in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout your house.

<p>Plastic pipe remains in wide use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century however did not become useful to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe started to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly typical, with a variety of fittings and products employed.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
