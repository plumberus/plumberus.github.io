<p>CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most common types of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
