Jim Dandy is the company to call with all your questions about trenchless sewer line repairs or pipe repair services.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
