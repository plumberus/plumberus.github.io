<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
