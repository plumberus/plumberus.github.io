Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
