<p>The quality of your house's WATER matters. You do not wish to fret about the problems of difficult water, and with NuvoH2O, you no longer need to! Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the marketplace-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
