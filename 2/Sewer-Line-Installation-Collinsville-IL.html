In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
