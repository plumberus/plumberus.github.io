<p>A water softener removes minerals that produce water solidity, one of the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water ruins home appliances, leaves cloudy soap residue across bathrooms and kitchens, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States counting on tough water for their bathing, cooking, and cleaning, water softeners serve a crucial function. A water softener conserves you from replacing too soon messed up water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Buying a water softener conserves you energy, time, and cash, and protects your home and your home.</p>
<p>Some homeowners may think of water softeners as a high-end product, something that's good to have" however not altogether needed. Nevertheless, tough water can trigger everything from small inconveniences, like spots on dishes or soap residue, to significant problems like a shorter lifespan for your water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary home appliances. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be a helpful investment for your house.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to hire a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
