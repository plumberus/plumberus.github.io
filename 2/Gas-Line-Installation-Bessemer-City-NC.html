<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these concerns can be credited to regular wear and tear or inappropriate installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes damaged by items that shouldn't be gone through it.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are harmless, but with time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
