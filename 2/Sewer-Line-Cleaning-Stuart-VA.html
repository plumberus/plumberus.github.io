In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

Difficult water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your utility costs will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of replacements and repairs will continue till your house is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
