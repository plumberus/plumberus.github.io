<p>Thank you a lot for taking the initiative to repair our water softener. over the holidays. We had actually been on trip throughout the time of repair and it was reassuring to know it had been taken care of and ready to go upon our return. For a plumber concentrating on drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Most problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>
