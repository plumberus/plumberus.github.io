<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at West Islip NY 11795?</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a terrible impact on your service. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential sewers and are more vulnerable to clogs and obstruction.

<p>Gas lines can be unsafe, and it's always best to tackle any problems with the assistance of a professional. Homeowners should never try to fix a gas line by themselves. One little mistake can trigger an explosion or a fire. There's no need to place everybody under your roofing system in danger and expose them to a potentially disastrous situation. Constantly hire the assistance of a specialist.</p>
