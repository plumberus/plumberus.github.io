Just like many professions in building and construction, there are peak periods that will require you to work overtime.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured.

That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
