<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it must be much less water.</p>

The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
