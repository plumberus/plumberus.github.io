<p>No other room in a home consists of as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are an excellent option s they can be quickly attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
