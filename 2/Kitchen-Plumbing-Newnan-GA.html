<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that relies on highly technical know-how and customized devices to recognize the area of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the area of those leakages at which noticeable water might or might not have emerged. Water temperature concerns can be repaired by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>

Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.
