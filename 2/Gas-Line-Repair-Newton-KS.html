<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to utilize Bio-Clean products for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly efficient at removing grime, waste, and natural material that so often blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and just partly repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively seek out natural product and gnaw at it, producing harmless byproducts of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
