The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
