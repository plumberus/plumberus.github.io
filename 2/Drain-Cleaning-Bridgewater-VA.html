<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
