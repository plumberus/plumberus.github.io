<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener.

When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
