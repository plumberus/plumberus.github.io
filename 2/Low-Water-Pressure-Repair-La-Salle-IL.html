<p>No other room in a house consists of as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to versatile rubber traps. Particles can easily catch in this type of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not offer needed support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are an excellent option s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
