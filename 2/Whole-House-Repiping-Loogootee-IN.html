<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Loogootee IN 47553</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
