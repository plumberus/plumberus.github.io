<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>

<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Trabuco Canyon CA 92679</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
