<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
