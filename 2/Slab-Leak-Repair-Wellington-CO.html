<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
