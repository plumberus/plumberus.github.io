<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
