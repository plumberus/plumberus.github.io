<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, available in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is highly advised for either community or well water products. No one wishes to walk into a bathroom or a kitchen and find a sink loaded with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be operating effectively in order to promote sanitary and safe living conditions also.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
