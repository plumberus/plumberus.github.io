So-called tough" water is the result of ground water going through and liquifying minerals and rocks, which then launch calcium and magnesium ions. These dissolved ions give difficult water its characteristics.</p>
<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new unit in.
