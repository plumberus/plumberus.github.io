<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Clover SC</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
