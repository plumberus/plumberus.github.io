<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from deterioration and may put toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home.
