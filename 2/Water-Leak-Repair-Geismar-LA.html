<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, however it does take place more frequently than you believe! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
