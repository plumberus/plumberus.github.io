<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program safeguards the general public water system from contaminants and pollutants that could, under specific scenarios, be drawn into the public water system from private properties. If you need a new toilet, the cost mostly depends on the toilet you select. Toilets differ in design, flushing effectiveness and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more costly than others. When installing a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks.

As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
