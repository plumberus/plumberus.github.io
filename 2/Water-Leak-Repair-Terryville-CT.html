It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
