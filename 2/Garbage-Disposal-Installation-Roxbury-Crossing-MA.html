<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
