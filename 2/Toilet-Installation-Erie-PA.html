<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Erie PA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
