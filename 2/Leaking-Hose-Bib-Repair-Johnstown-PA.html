Changing the pipes for lots of plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>A lot of plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the new one at the very same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the new unit, therefore increasing costs.
