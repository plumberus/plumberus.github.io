<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
