Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Because soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
