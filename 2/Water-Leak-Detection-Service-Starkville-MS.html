<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is happy to use Bio-Clean products for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and remarkably effective at getting rid of grime, waste, and natural material that so frequently blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and just partly repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for natural material and gnaw at it, creating safe byproducts of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are quickly treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>The cost can vary based upon the length of the pipes and level of damage, but nationwide average expenses for a camera inspection are $500. Some areas charge less.

<p>Culpeper Home Services supplies professional garbage disposal solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will present you with choices for repair or replacement and advise the best service depending upon your specific needs. For double-bowl sinks, the best method to tackle things is to utilize a continuous waste disposer kit including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet package.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by aligning it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
