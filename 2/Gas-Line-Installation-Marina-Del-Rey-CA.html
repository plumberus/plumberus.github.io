Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health threat if backflows occur from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and then each year.</p>
