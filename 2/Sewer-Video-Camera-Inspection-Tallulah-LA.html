<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our rigid trust accreditation requirements. A great rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
