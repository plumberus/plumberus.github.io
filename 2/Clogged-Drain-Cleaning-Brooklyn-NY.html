<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the option with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is free of solidity ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
