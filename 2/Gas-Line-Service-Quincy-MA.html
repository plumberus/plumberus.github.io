<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Quincy MA 02169</h3>
<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken home appliance is frustrating to handle, the good news is that installing a replacement disposal will be cheaper than installing a new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never ever had one previously. Depending on the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
