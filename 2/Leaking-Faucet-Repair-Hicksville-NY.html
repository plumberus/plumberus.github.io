<p>Ensuring plumbing equipment such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are separated to their own respective networks is crucial in order to preserve safe and clean water security. When buying a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is quite standard. If it's a rental I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be among the most costly repair projects if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you may need all of your water piping replaced. Again, extremely pricey. This is simply among many issues that can surface.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.
