<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
