If your energy bills are rising, a brand-new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting difficult water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its new place and put there.</p>
