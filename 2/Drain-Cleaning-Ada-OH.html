Some tough water problems are very noticeable, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged.

Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs.

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling.

Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
