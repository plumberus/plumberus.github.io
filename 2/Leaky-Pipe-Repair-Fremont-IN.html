<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
