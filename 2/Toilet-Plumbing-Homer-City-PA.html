<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to pass through. The pipes typically make weird gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are generally situated behind the sink, in confined spaces. The best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much area and need a large swing angle, which might be difficult to obtain in little spaces.</p>
