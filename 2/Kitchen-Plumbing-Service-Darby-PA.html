These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
