<p>When a large sufficient source of water has been determined and assessed, the third major component of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water system and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of protection for the general public water supply system.</p>
