<h3>Bathtub Faucet Replacement in Benton Illinois</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have achieved a development in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of short-lived solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant limitations of existing softening technologies.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
