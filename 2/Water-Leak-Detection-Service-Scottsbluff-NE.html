<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs many items to be examined. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be assessed.

The backflow prevention assembly must be taken apart and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked again to be sure it was properly fixed.
