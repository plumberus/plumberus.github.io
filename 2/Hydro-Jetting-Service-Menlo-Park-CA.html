<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair in Menlo Park CA 94025</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
