<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
