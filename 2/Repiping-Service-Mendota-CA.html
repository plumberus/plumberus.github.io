<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health hazard conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
