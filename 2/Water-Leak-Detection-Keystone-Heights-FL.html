<p>Think of all the areas water flows in and out of your home. These are the areas that a professional assessment ought to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines ought to be covered.

To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
