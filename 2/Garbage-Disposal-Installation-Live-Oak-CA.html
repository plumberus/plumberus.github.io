Idea: Location a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the inside.
