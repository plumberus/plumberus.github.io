<p>Lastly, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
