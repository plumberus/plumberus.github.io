<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Mountain View CA</h3>
<p>A recently installed water heater need to not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things worsen dramatically for homes with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Repairing a gas line is really changing a gas line - if it's defective it needs to be changed. The cost of gas line replacement is figured out by the cost of labor and materials. The variance of the cost depends upon whether the job is a simple gas leak repair or a full replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for brand-new home appliances are charged individually.</p>
