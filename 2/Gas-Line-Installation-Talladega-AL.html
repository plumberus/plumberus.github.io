However, if you're constantly calling us for repairs, the costs can acquire and break past that rate point prior to you know it.

<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A small round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.
