<p>Once in awhile, every toilet blockages. How typically a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
