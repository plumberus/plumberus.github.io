<p>No other room in a home includes as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to versatile rubber traps.

There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I mention them only.</p>
