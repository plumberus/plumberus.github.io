<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
