<p>Hard water usage might affect the efficiency of household appliances. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale accumulation slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also collect to plug plumbing components and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus affecting their performance.</p>
