Water pressure might be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Some homeowners may think about water softeners as a high-end item, something that's great to have" but not completely necessary. Nevertheless, hard water can trigger whatever from minor inconveniences, like spots on dishes or soap residue, to major problems like a much shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary house devices. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful financial investment for your house.</p>
