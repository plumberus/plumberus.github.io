<p>Sinkholes don't only occur in your lawn, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to discover out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's structure.

Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.
