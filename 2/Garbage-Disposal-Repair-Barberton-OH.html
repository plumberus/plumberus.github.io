When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the more affordable and much better long-term option.</p>
