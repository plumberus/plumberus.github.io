<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing business.

The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply adequate flow.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
