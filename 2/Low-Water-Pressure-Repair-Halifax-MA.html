<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature level to see if hardness had an effect on detergent savings.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

Funneling happens when the incoming hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.
