<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While some of these problems can be attributed to typical wear and tear or improper installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit ends up being harmed by products that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>Whether you're redesigning your bathroom or just updating old components, changing a toilet can be a big task if you have actually never done it before.
