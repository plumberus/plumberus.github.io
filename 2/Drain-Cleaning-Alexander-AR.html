<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Alexander AR</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Also referred to as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we rotate on our end to unclog drains. This technique works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and debris, such as showers and sinks. Backflow is the flow of water in the incorrect direction from a consumer's water system into the public water system. Backflow may be triggered by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
