<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
