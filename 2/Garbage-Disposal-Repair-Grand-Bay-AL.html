Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from deterioration and may put toxins into the freshwater supply.
