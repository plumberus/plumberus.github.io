<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
