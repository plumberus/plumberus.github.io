<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>They will usually stand behind their work with an assurance if you're working with a credible plumber in Utah.

When that occurs, you will probably need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your mistakes, and possibilities are they will cost more and be harder than if you had just called a professional in the very first location.</p>
