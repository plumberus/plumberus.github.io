During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
