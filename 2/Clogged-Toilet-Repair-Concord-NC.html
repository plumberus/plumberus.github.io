But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Concord NC 28027</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
