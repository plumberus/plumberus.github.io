<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
