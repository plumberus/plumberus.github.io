While a few of these problems can be credited to normal wear and tear or inappropriate installation, often your garbage disposal ends up being harmed by products that should not be run through it.</p>

There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. Due to the fact that they will be on an accreditation test, I discuss them only.</p>
