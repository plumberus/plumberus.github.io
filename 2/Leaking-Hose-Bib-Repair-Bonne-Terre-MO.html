<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Bonne Terre MO</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
