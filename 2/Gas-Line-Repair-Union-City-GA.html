<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>You must also periodically examine your hot water heater burner. The flame under the heater need to appear blue with yellow suggestions. If it's mainly yellow, or if it's sooty under there, your flue might be clogged, which is a harmful scenario. Contact a professional to check it out.
