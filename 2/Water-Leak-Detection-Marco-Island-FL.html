<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Most kitchen sink obstructions are due to heavy grease accumulation and food particles.

Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
