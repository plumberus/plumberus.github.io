<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess.

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time related. If whatever is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
