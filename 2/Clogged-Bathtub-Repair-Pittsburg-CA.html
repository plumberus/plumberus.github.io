<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is specifically real if you have untreated tough water, which contains harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair. Leakages typically imply a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
