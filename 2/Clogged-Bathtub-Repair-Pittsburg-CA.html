<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Basically, soft water conserves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is specifically real if you have untreated tough water, which contains harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair. Leakages typically imply a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
