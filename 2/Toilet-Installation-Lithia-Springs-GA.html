<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling.

Cleaners need to be utilized according to manufacturer guidelines to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing components in your house? Water pressure in the home is similar to high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is MUCH more economical than mold remediation or replacing flooring or drywall! So we suggest installing or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your entire home.</p>
