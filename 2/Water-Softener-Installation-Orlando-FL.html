<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin.
