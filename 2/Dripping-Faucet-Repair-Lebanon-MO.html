<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
