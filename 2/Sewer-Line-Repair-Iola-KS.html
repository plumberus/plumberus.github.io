<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
