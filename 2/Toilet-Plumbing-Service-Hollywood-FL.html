<p>The very first thing you need is a right diagnosis of the issue Whenever you experience any type of plumbing issue. There can be many factors somebody is experiencing problems with their drains or sewer lines, and just a professional can provide an appropriate diagnosis. We ask that you do not lose at any time trying to figure out the factor behind your plumbing problems, as this can further postpone seeking the professional help you need.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
