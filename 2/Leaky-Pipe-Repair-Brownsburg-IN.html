<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
