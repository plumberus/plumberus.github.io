<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" design. It is extremely recommended for either municipal or well water materials. Nobody wishes to walk into a bathroom or a kitchen and discover a sink filled with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be operating properly in order to uphold safe and sanitary living conditions also.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
