If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
