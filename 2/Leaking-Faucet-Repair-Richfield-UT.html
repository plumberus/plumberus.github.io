<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener.

As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue.

In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
