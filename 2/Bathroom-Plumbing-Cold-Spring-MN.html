Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Cold Spring MN</h3>
<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line throughout installation. Fewer parts in the unit lead to less tankless water heater repair appointments.</p>
