The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health threat or health hazard conditions. They must be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.
