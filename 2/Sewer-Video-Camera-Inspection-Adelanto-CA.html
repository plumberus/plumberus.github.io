<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and could not be happier with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
