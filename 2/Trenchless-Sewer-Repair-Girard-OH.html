<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
