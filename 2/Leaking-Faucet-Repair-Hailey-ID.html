The LADBS application must be submitted and paid for a minimum of two (2) service days prior to the date of the occasion, AND, after you have actually acquired all other needed approvals or clearances from all other firms. Garbage disposals can be made of either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is less costly but more vulnerable to leaking and corrosion. Stainless-steel blades are likewise more durable.
