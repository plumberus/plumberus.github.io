<p>Difficult water use might affect the performance of household home appliances. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater.

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
