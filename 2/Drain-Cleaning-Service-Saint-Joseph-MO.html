<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
