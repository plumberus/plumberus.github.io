<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess.

I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or small task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your house, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disruption to your daily regimen. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible undamaged.</p>
