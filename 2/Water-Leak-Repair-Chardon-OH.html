<p>These types of warm water heaters are typically powered by natural gas because it is more economical to power them with gas than with electrical energy. Gas water heaters cost more than electric water heaters to install at first, but end up costing about half as much to run - conserving you substantial quantities of money on your utility costs in the long run.</p>
