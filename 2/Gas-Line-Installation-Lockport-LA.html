The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation.

<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Lockport LA</h3>
<p>Whether you need electric, gas, or tankless water heaters, we have the ideal one for your home. The most conventional and popular design of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's communities is a gas or electrical tank unit. These units save just the right amount of hot water for your convenience. A tankless water heater would be best if you are looking to conserve more energy and lower your water bill because it just heats water, as you use it not when you don't.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
