<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>A job of setting up that brand-new toilet or trendy faucet must be a job for a licensed plumber with everything at his finger pointers to include his understanding and experience.
