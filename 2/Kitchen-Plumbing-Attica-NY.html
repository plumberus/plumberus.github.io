<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractors in Attica</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted problems on your property. A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
