<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Sioux City IA 51106</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had numerous plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely suggest them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
<p>Picture living in a house with soft water-- a house where you do not have unusual films on your meals or mirrors, can lather soap easily, and do not need to worry about scaling on the inside or beyond your devices. Sounds good, does not it? What if we informed you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environment-friendly water systems for homes, you can.</p>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, bathtub, or shower) can be corrected quickly if the blockage is shallow and easy. For the majority of clogs you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, but if this does not solve the problem then you might likewise have to employ a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
