<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>We specialize in entire house re-pipes, new plumbing setups, and mainline water service replacement. Whether you need help with a small repair, a re-pipe or a remodel, you can ensure that the work will be completed the very first time properly. Low water pressure might be due to a multitude of factors, but the most common factors are sediment accumulation and deterioration, which both block water from going through the whole pipe and put unneeded pressure on specific sections of pipe.</p>
