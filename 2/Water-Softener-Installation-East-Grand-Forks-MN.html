<p>In order to avoid your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay attention to what is being washed down your system.

<p>As always, if you smell gas or suspect a gas leak, leave the area instantly on foot. Do NOT use your phone, electrical switches, computer system, or anything that could cause a trigger. Go straight to a safe place in a neighboring home or building, and after that call 911 and CenterPoint Energy at 1-800-296-9815 or 612-372-5050 immediately. Position the water softener.
