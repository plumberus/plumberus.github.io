Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
