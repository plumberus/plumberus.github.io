<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Sometimes it might be required to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to manufacturer directions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>A water softening system may not be the very best option for every single property owner, especially if you're just looking to enhance certain aspects of your water, like the taste, instead of resolving hardness in general. Luckily, there are many options offered for improving the taste of your water, as well as for softening the water to specific appliances or fixtures.</p>
