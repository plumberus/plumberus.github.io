<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that usually means that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in several locations and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
