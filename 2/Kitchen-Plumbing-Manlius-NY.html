<p>Commercial structures with pitch roofings may also need roofing drain cleaning. Their roofing system rain gutters are usually connected to 4-inch size vertical roofing system drain pipes, which in turn, link to 4-inch diameter underground horizontal pipes that flow into municipal storm drains just listed below street level.
