<h3>You Can Save Money With Water Leak Detection in Tolland CT 06084</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
