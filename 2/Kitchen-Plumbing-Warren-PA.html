<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in brand-new houses, but many homes built in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When found and changed with another pipe product, galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber.</p>
