<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and obligation are exceptionally essential to developing a reputation for excellence. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet should be above the drain line coming out of the wall.

A functional sewer line need to always be sealed airtight, meaning no water or gas ought to ever leak out. If however, you begin smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around your house, there could be a crack somewhere in your sewer line.</p>

If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
