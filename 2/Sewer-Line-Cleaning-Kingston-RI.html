<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
