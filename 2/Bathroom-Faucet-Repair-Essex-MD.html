This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
