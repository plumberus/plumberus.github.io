<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
