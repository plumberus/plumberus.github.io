<p>Thank you so much for taking the initiative to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on getaway throughout the time of repair and it was reassuring to know it had been looked after and ready to go upon our return. For a plumber concentrating on drain-clearing services, anticipate to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Most problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the per hour rate.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater.
