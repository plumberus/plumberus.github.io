<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again important for the repair service technician to be familiar with the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning process is not damaging. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to decrease any scale development or rust. It is important that the repair technician is sensitive to the solidity and type of the different finishings used on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective covering.</p>
