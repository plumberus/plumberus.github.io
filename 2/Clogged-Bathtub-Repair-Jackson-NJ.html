<p>As an entrepreneur, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating result on your business. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more use and tear than residential drains and are more vulnerable to obstructions and blockage.

<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
