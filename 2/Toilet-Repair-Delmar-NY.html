The actions for replacing a propane hot water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we recommend replacing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. Schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak.
